Description: This package provides utilities for generating ANOVA keyouts and calculating containment 
  degrees of freedom for (almost) any, arbitrarily complex treatment and design structure, with the aim
  of assisting students in understanding the implications of experimental design on statistical power   
  and correcting the denomonator degrees of freedom in lme models with crossed random effects.
